# FacebookGroupGrabber
Grabs Facebook Group data.
Members are exported in CSV format. Posts are exported as JSON files, all downloadable in a single zip file, which includes scaled images.
This relies on the user facing interface of Facebook, therefore Facebook can't ever deny access to it. All Facebook can do is to obfuscate its output, in which case we are in a whack-a-mole game.
